#My First Webpage

This was the first webpage I ever created, and submitted as my entrance project when I applied for Holberton Coding School. I made it in about three days with no previous expirience.
To me it is a personal reminder of not only how far I have come but also that as long as you are willing to dedicate time and effort, there is nothing you cannot achieve.
