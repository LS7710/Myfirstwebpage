            <b>My name is Luis and this is my first time creating a website in HTML. I am a second year Biology student that was studying at UPR of Aguadilla. <br>
                 About halfway through my second semester I realized that Biology and medicine were not for me. I am now deciding to change career path to something <br>
                 that I actually enjoy and am passionate about. I've always liked working with computers and learning what allows us to do so many incredible things <br>
                 with them as well as the software that runs on them and now, hopefully, I will be able to create and fix them first hand for a living.

    <h3>
        <b>My dream is to master all skills related to full stack and cyber security and hopefully become one of the best in this field. <br>
          I would also like to learn about other areas within coding that I may not know about that might appeal to me and even become my specialization. <br>
           Areas like AI or game development which I havnt researched much but might be of interest to me and might be what I choose to focus on. <br>
           In general I wish to become a great software engineer and learn as much about the different areas of coding as I can.

        Dream Companies I'd Like to Work For
     </h1>
     <br><br><br>

     <h3>
        Here are a couple of companies I'd like to work for in the future. Although they are somewhat different to one another I like them all for different reasons. <br>
        For example Lockheed Martin seems interesting to me because of all the diversity of projects they work on, like air crafts, and advanved artificial inteligence systems. <br>
        Microsoft and Google have always been some of the most sought after companies by aspiring software engineers since they have been some of the biggest tech companies of <br>
        our time. Secureworks appeals to me because of its focus on cybersecurity, which is something I aspire to do in the future. Finally companies like Rockstar games and <br>
        Blizzard Entertainment are two companies whose games I grew up playing and would love to work for one day If I ever get into game development.

    <h3>
      <b> 
        Video games have been a big part of my life and one of my favorite hobbies. Although currently I do not wish to make video game development <br>
         the focus of my career it's something I find interesting and my shift my focus on to once I master the other areas I want to focus on first. <br>
         I made this small game of snake with the help of a simple youtube tutorial. I am more than excited to see what I will be able to learn with <br>
         the help of Holberton. I like game development because I have seen the incredible things many game development companies have been able to achieve <br>
         and I find the idea of bringing to life something, that at one point was too hard to even imagine, with the use of code.
